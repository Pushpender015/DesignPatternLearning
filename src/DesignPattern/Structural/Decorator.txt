------ DECORATOR DESIGN PATTERN (Structural) ------

	# WHAT IS DECORATOR PATTERN?

		The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you add new behavior to an object at runtime by wrapping it, without changing its class.

	In simple words:
		“Attach extra features to an object dynamically.”
		Decorator follows Open/Closed Principle.

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT DECORATOR?

		You create many subclasses for every feature
		Class explosion happens
		Hard to maintain

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES DECORATOR SOLVE?

		Adds behavior dynamically
		Avoids subclass explosion
		Supports combination of features
		Follows OCP

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		( Pizza toppings )
		Base Pizza ? Add cheese ? Add olives ? Add sauce
		Each topping wraps the previous one.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Flexible
		No subclass explosion
		Open/Closed

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Many small objects
		Hard debugging

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Not using same interface
		Not wrapping correctly
