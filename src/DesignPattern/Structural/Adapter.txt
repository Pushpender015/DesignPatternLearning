------ Adapter pattern ------

	Define : The Adapter Pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by using a wrapper class.
				It acts as a bridge between old and new systems.

		In simple words:
			- “Convert one interface into another that client expects.”

		# What problem does this pattern solve?
			- Wrap old system
			- Provide new interface
			- No code changes to old class
			- Loose coupling

		# Real-Life Analogy + Mapping
