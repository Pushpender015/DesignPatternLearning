---- FACADE DESIGN PATTERN (Structural) ----

	# WHAT IS FACADE PATTERN?
		The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem.

		In simple words:

		Facade is a front desk that hides internal complexity.
		Client talks only to Facade, not to all subsystems.

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT FACADE?
		
		Client must call many subsystem classes
		Client knows internal workflow
		Tight coupling
		Hard to change

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES FACADE SOLVE?

		Hides complexity
		Reduces coupling
		Improves readability
		Simplifies usage

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		( Hotel Reception )
		Guest ? Reception ? Housekeeping, Kitchen, Security
		Guest doesn’t know internal systems.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Simple API
		Loose coupling
		Easy to use

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Facade can become god class

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Putting business logic in facade
		Too many responsibilities
