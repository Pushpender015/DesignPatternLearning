------ Composite Structural pattern ------

Define : This is structural design pattern that enables the creation of tree-like structures
			to represent collection of objects, where both individual object and 
			groups of objects are treated in unfited manner.

	It creates a tree structure where:
		Leaf = single object
		Composite = group of objects
			- Both follow the same interface.

	Q. what problem solve this pattern ??
		- same interface for all nodes.
		- client doesn't care if it is a single or group
		- Easy to add new types
		- Clean tree traversal

	# Real-Life Analogy + Mapping
		File System
		Real Life			Code
		File				Leaf
		Folder				Composite
		Size()				Operation

		Both File & Folder support GetSize().
