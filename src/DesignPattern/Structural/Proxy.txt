--- PROXY DESIGN PATTERN (Structural) ----

	WHAT IS PROXY PATTERN?
		The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it.

	In simple words:
		A Proxy acts like a gatekeeper for the real object.
		Client talks to proxy, proxy decides whether to forward the request.

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT PROXY?

		Client accesses real object directly
		No control over heavy, sensitive, or remote objects
		No security, caching, logging, lazy loading

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES PROXY SOLVE?

		Proxy allows:
		Lazy loading
		Access control
		Logging & caching
		Remote access
		It protects the real object.

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		Security Guard
		You (client) ? Guard (proxy) ? CEO (real object)
		You cannot directly meet CEO.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Lazy loading
		Security
		Logging
		Access control

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Extra layer
		Performance overhead

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Proxy doing real work
		Not sharing interface
