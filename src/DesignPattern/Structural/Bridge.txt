----- BRIDGE DESIGN PATTERN (Structural) ------

	# WHAT IS BRIDGE PATTERN?
		- The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates abstraction from implementation so that both can change independently.

	In simple words:
		-Bridge splits a big class or inheritance hierarchy into two parts:

	 => Abstraction (what to do) , Implementation (how to do)

	They are connected using composition, not inheritance.

	So instead of:
		Big inheritance trees
	We use:
		Interface + reference to implementation 

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT BRIDGE?
		- We create large inheritance hierarchies

		- Every new feature multiplies classes

		- Code becomes rigid

	# Example

		RemoteTV
		RemoteRadio
		AdvancedRemoteTV
		AdvancedRemoteRadio

		For every new device ? more subclasses

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES BRIDGE SOLVE?

		Bridge allows:
		
		Changing abstraction without touching implementation

		Changing implementation without touching abstraction

		Avoiding class explosion

		Following OCP & DIP

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		Remote Control + Devices

		Remote = Abstraction
		TV / Radio = Implementation

		You can change the remote OR device independently.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Reduces class explosion

		Independent changes

		Loose coupling

	# DISADVANTAGES

		More classes

		Hard to understand initially

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Using inheritance instead of composition

		Not separating abstraction & implementation
