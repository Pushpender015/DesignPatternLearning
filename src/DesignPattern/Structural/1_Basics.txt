----- Structural Design Pattern -----

deifne : How classes and object are connected and composed to form larger, flexible structure
	
	Note : they don't create objects ( that's creational )
		 : they don't manages behaviour ; communication ( that's behavioural )

	Q. what problem SP solve ?
		- you wrap existing classes 
		- you connect incompatible classes 
		- you add features without changing code
		- you simplify complex subsystems.

	# They help you follow:
		SRP , OCP , DIP , Loose Coupling

	# Real-Life Analogy + Mapping
		Universal Power Adapter

		Different countries have different sockets.
		Your charger won’t fit. So you use an adapter.

		You don’t change:
		your charger , the wall socket - You just wrap the connection.

		This is the core idea of structural patterns:
			Wrap, connect, extend — without changing existing code.
