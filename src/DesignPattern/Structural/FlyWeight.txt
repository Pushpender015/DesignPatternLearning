---- FLYWEIGHT DESIGN PATTERN (Structural) ----

	# WHAT IS FLYWEIGHT PATTERN?
		The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern used to reduce memory usage by sharing common object data among many objects.

	In simple words:
		Instead of creating thousands of heavy objects,
		you share common parts and store only unique data separately.

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT FLYWEIGHT?:

		Thousands of similar objects
		High memory usage
		Performance issues

	# Example
		Creating 1 million tree objects with same texture, color, model.

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES FLYWEIGHT SOLVE?

		Flyweight splits object state into:
		Intrinsic state ? shared, common
		Extrinsic state ? unique, passed from outside
		So memory is saved by sharing intrinsic data.

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		( Text Editor Characters )
		Each 'A' shares:
		Font
		Shape
		But position (row, column) is unique.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Saves memory
		Improves performance
		Efficient for large objects

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Complex logic
		Must manage extrinsic state carefully

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Sharing mutable data
		Storing extrinsic state inside flyweight
