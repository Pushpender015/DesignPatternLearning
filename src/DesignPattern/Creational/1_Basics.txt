----- CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS (Concept) -----

	# WHAT ARE CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS?
		Creational Design Patterns focus on how objects are created in a system.
		They do not create objects directly using new everywhere.
		Instead, they control and manage object creation logic.

	In simple words:
		“Creational patterns decide how and when objects should be created.”

	They separate:
		Object creation
		Object usage
		- So client code does NOT depend on concrete classes.

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT CREATIONAL PATTERNS?

		Code uses new everywhere
		Tight coupling to concrete classes
		Hard to change object type
		Hard to test
			- If database changes ? change everywhere.

	# WHAT PROBLEM DO CREATIONAL PATTERNS SOLVE?

		Hide creation logic
		Reduce tight coupling
		Support OCP & DIP
		Make system flexible
		Allow runtime object selection
		Client depends on abstraction, not concrete class.

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		( Car Factory )
		You don’t build engine, tyres, doors manually.
		You place order ? factory decides how to build.
		You don’t say new Engine(), you say:

		“Give me a car.”

		That is Creational Pattern thinking.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Loose coupling
		Centralized creation
		Easy to change
		Easy testing

	# DISADVANTAGES

		More classes
		Slight complexity

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Still using new in client
		No abstraction
		Hardcoding types
