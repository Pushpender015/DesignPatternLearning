------ PROTOTYPE DESIGN PATTERN (Creational) ------

	# WHAT IS PROTOTYPE PATTERN?

		The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning an existing object, instead of creating from scratch.

		In simple words:
			“Create new object by copying an existing one.”

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT PROTOTYPE?

		Creating objects is expensive (DB, API, config)
		Initialization logic repeated
		Performance issues

	# Example
		Loading game characters with heavy textures repeatedly.

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES PROTOTYPE SOLVE?

		Clones existing object
		Avoids heavy creation
		Improves performance
		Allows dynamic object creation

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		Photocopy Machine
		Instead of writing again, you copy.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Fast object creation
		Avoids complex initialization

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Deep copy is tricky
		Circular references

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Shallow copy when deep is needed
