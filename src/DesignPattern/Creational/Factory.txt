----- FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN (Creational) -----

	# WHAT IS FACTORY PATTERN?

		The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a method to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.

		In simple words:

			“Client asks factory for object instead of using new.”
			The factory decides which object to create.

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT FACTORY?

		- Client uses new directly
		- Code becomes tightly coupled
		- Hard to add new types
		- Violates OCP

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES FACTORY SOLVE?

		- Hides object creation
		- Reduces coupling
		- Centralizes logic
		- Supports OCP

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		( Vehicle Factory )
		You say: “Give me a bike”
		Factory decides how to build it.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Loose coupling
		Central creation
		Easy extension

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Factory grows with many if-else
		 
	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Hardcoding strings
		Big switch-case
