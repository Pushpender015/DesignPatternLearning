------ BUILDER DESIGN PATTERN (Creational) -----

	# WHAT IS BUILDER PATTERN?

		The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step-by-step.

		It separates:
			How an object is built
			from
			How it is represented

		In simple words:
			“Build a complex object step by step.”

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT BUILDER?

		Constructors with many parameters
		Confusing object creation
		Hard to maintain

	# Example

		new House("2BHK", true, true, false, true);
		   - Nobody knows what true/false means

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES BUILDER SOLVE?

		Creates readable object creation
		Avoids telescoping constructors
		Allows different representations
		Improves clarity

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

			You choose:
			Bun
			Patty
			Cheese
			Sauce
				- Chef builds step by step.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Step-by-step creation
		Clear code
		Multiple representations
	
	# DISADVANTAGES

		More classes
		Complex for simple objects

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Mixing product & builder
		Skipping director logic
