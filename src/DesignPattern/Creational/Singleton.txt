----- SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERN (Creational) -----

	# WHAT IS SINGLETON PATTERN?

		The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.

		In simple words:
		“Only one object for the whole application.”

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT SINGLETON?

		Multiple objects of same resource
		Data inconsistency
		Resource wastage

	# Example
		Multiple database connections.

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES SINGLETON SOLVE?

		Guarantees one instance
		Centralized control
		Controlled access

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		President of a country
		Only one at a time.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Controlled instance
		Saves memory

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Global state
		Hard to test

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Public constructor
		Not thread safe
