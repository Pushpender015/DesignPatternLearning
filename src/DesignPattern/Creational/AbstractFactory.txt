----- ABSTRACT FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN (Creational) -----

	# WHAT IS ABSTRACT FACTORY PATTERN?

	The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

	In simple words:
		“Factory of factories.”
		It is used when:
		Objects belong to a group (family)
		You want to ensure matching objects are created together.

	# WHAT PROBLEM ARISES WITHOUT ABSTRACT FACTORY?

		Client must know which concrete factory to use
		Risk of mixing incompatible objects
		Tight coupling

	# Example
		Creating WindowsButton with MacCheckbox.

	# WHAT PROBLEM DOES ABSTRACT FACTORY SOLVE?

		Abstract Factory:
		Ensures compatible products
		Hides concrete classes
		Supports OCP
		Decouples client

	# REAL LIFE ANALOGY

		( Furniture Factory )
		ModernFactory ? ModernChair, ModernTable
		ClassicFactory ? ClassicChair, ClassicTable
		You never mix styles.

	# ADVANTAGES

		Consistency
		Loose coupling
		Easy to switch families

	# DISADVANTAGES

		Hard to add new product type

	# COMMON MISTAKES

		Mixing families
		Too many interfaces
